# Nix development shells

Dev shells for the various languages I work with.

## Environment Index
### Rust
```shell
nix develop ./rust
```
### Java
```shell
nix develop ./java
```
### Python
```shell
nix develop ./python
```

To install packages through pip, run `python -m venv .venv` to spin up a virtual environment in the current working directory.
